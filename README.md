# BASS version 4.1
This repository contains the implementation of _BASS_,  a group factor analysis model with Bayesian structured sparsity priors.
For details of the model, please see http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2698.

# Introduction
## _BASS_ stands for _B_ayesian group factor _A_nalysis with _S_tructured _S_parsity priors. 
It extends traditional factor analysis model to _m_ coupled observation matrices (views).

It could be used to estimate both covariance specific to each observation matrix 
and shared variation across any subset of observations.
