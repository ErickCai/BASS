# BASS version 4.1
This repository contains the implementation of _BASS_,  a group factor analysis model with Bayesian structured sparsity priors.
For details of the model, please see http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2698.

# Introduction
## _BASS_ stands for Bayesian group factor Analysis with Structured Sparsity priors. 
It extends traditional factor analysis model to _m_ coupled observation matrices (views).

BASS could be used to estimate both covariance specific to each observation matrix 
and shared variation across any subset of observations. 

# About the folders
* _simData_ contains simulation data sets used in the orignal paper of BASS.
* _code_ contains all source code of implementing BASS.
* _output_ contains the output files/folders after running BASS.
